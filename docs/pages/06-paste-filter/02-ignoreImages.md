# Ignore Images in Pasted Content

**Note: this chapter doesn't apply to IE 11.**

The content copied from the website or office may contain images in addition to the text. These pisctures from external domains generally may not be displayed due to anti-leech processing.

The `pasteIgnoreImg` can ingore images in the pasted text:
```javascript
editor.config.pasteIgnoreImg = false
```

If that, the image will not be pasted if included in the copied in the text.
