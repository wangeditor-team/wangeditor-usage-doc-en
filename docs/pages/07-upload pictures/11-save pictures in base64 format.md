# Save pictures in base64 format

Set `editor.config.uploadImgShowBase64 = true` to save pictures in base64 format. That is, you can select a local picture, and the editor will display the picture in base64 format.

**Note:uploadImgShowBase64 (base64 format) and uploadImgServer (upload pictures to the server) cannot be used at the same time! ! !**
